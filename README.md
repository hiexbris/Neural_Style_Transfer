# 🎨 **Neural Style Transfer with VGG19 & Gram Matrix**

A creative deep learning project that blends the **content** of one image with the **style** of another using the power of **VGG19** convolutional neural network and **Gram matrix** calculations to generate stunning artistic images.

---

## 📖 **About**

Implemented Neural Style Transfer to explore deep learning concepts, using pretrained **VGG19** to extract image features and **Gram matrix** to capture style patterns. This project demonstrates how AI can create unique artworks by combining content and style efficiently.

## ⚙️ **Features**

- 🖼️ Transfers artistic styles onto content images  
- 🧠 Utilizes pretrained **VGG19** for feature extraction  
- ✨ Uses **Gram matrix** to represent and apply style textures  
- 🔄 Optimizes generated images through iterative loss minimization  
- 📊 Visualizes style and content losses during training  
- 💻 Modular, easy-to-understand Python implementation
